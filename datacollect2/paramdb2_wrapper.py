This module contains funcionality needed to use paramdb inside other Python
scripts.  It will launch a dbus session in a new process and start
responding to requests until it is stopped.  An example use case for this
module is when using Python to call and run MATLAB COMSOL automation
scripts.  Many of these modules depend on dc_param to capture values and
this is not feasable in the context of a Python automation script.  This
wrapper fills that void.

The suggested method to import this module is the following:

>>> import paramdb2_wrapper as pdb2

This module contains a class object to act as a storage container.

    Wrapper Class for Paramdb2

    Initialization of this class will create an empty list that can be
    populated with the addcmd function.  Commands should follow the
    same format as within a typical dcc file.  The parameter database
    is provided in this context as 'paramdb' just as it is within the
    context of dcc files.  M4 includes will not be executed and will
    return in error.

    Call the run function to start the gobject main loop and enable the
    dbus service to respond to requests.  Terminate the loop by calling
    the stop function.

    Usage:
      >>> # Set Up Server
      >>> import paramdb2_wrapper as pdb2
      >>> pdbobj = pdb2.paramdb2_wrapper()
      >>> pdbobj.addcmd("paramdb.addparam('specimen', stringv)")
