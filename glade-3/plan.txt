  * Define widgets that can use dg_io to talk directly to server
  * Lay out with glade, distribute dg_io parameter to them, and create the
top level for a basic GUI

  * Procedures: 
   Each procedure consists of a series of steps. 

   Each step template consists of a glade file with the interface, plus 
   a python file with the interface logic. Should be arranged as a 
   checklist with checkboxes on the right. 

   The procedure file references the step template, and any necessary 
   modifications

   Each step goes in an expander. The current step is highlighted.  
   Checking all the boxes moves to the next step. Double-clicking 
   a step jumps back to it. 

   A step can also be a sub-procedure.
