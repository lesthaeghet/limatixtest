# Note: datacollect config files are passed through an m4 preprocessor
# so you can use e.g. "m4_include([[includefile.dcc]])" to include
# another file. As an alternative you can manually load multiple config
# files before opening your experiment log, either from the 
# datacollect command line or from the datacollect gui


# call createparamserver() if dbus (i.e. python/matlab/etc.) access to the parameter 
# database is likely to be needed.
# createparamserver()  # Multiple calls to createparamserver() are OK
