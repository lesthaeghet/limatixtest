Prerequisites:
  python (version 2.7 or 3.x... 3.x is a bit of a work in progress)
  python-lxml (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  numpy (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  gtk2 and pygtk2 (on python2;  required to use GUI components)
  gtk3 and python bindings (on python3;  required to use GUI components)
  python-pillow (required for Ricoh camera support)
  glade-3.6.7 (required for interative gtk2 widget layout; not needed for
               general use)

  canonicalize_path
  dc_lxml_treesync
  dataguzzler-lib
  datacollect2-QAutils (not used directly, but documents checklist
                        format/structure and can render checklists as PDF)
  
Datacollect2 can be installed simply by unpacking the archive in a suitable
location once these prerequisites are installed. You may want to add the
'bin' directory to your system PATH and/or insert symbolic links to the
files in the 'bin' directory. You may also want to add the 'lib' directory
to your system PYTHONPATH. 

To install into /usr/local/datacollect2 on Linux or Unix/MacOS platforms:
  "make"
  "sudo make install"
