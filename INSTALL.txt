
Prerequisites:
  python (version 2.7 or 3.x... 3.x is a bit of a work in progress)
  python-lxml (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  numpy (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  pytz (Python timezone library; sometimes listed as 'python-tz')
  gtk2 and pygtk2 (on python2;  required to use GUI components)
  gtk3 and python bindings (on python3;  required to use GUI components)
  setuptools (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)


Recommended:
  python-pillow (required for Ricoh camera support and for representing parameters that are images)
  glade-3.6.7 (required for interative gtk2 widget layout; not needed for
               general use)
  limatix-qautils (not used directly, but documents checklist
         	   format/structure and can render checklists as PDF)
  ipython (with PySide QT4 bindings) for interactive debugging of 
          processtrak scripts
  matplotlib (with QT4 support) for use with ipython for interactive
             debugging of processtrak scripts

Limatix should work on all major platforms with the above packages.
In most cases you will want to use a package manager or a Python
distribution such as Canopy or Anaconda to provide the packages. 
Detailed installation instructions for Windows are included below. 

Limatix is built with Python setuptools:

To build from source package:
  python setup.py build

To install into Python site-packages (as root)
  python setup.py install
  python setup.py install_data

Note that the install_data step also installs some useful files
into $(PREFIX)/share/limatix where $(PREFIX) is the Python
installation prefix. These include sample checklists, configuration
files, documentation, and processtrak steps.



Windows installation instructions
---------------------------------
   RUN WITH A 32-BIT PYTHON 2.7 INSTALLATAION
1. Install Anaconda Python 2.7 version 32 bit or Enthought
   Canopy 32 bit. http://www.continuum.io or 
   http://www.enthought.com
2. Get latest pygtk all-in-one package from www.pygtk.org
3. Install PyGTK Python 2.7 all-in-one, making sure it 
   installs into the Anaconda or Canopy distribution from 
   above. 
4. Open an Anaconda or Canopy command prompt, change to 
   your Limatix source tree directory, then run:
     python setup.py install
     python setup.py install_data
   This will install Limatix into your Anaconda or Canopy
   installation
5. From an Anaconda or Canopy command prompt you should 
   now be able to run 'datacollect2', 'processtrak', etc.
6. Anaconda does not install the "PySide" QT bindings for 
   IPython/Matplotlib by default. To make ProcessTrak's
   IPython mode work, run "conda install pyside" from an
   Anaconda command prompt. 
7. Also obtain a good XML editor that supports syntax
   highlighting to associate with the various Limatix XML
   file types.



A note on 32-bit vs. 64-bit on Windows
--------------------------------------
The current Limatix platform is Python 2.7/GTK 2.x. 
PyGTK 2.x is only available for 32 bit Windows, hence
installation of 32-bit Python versions. 

Limatix will work fine on 64 bit Python, but on Windows 
that means you will need to use GTK3 (--gtk3 command
line parameter). GTK3 support has not been extensively
tested and is missing some key functionality such as 
colored widgets. 

ProcessTrak does not require GTK and will work fine
on 64 bit Python
