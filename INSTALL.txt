
Prerequisites:
  python (version 2.7 or 3.x... 3.x is a bit of a work in progress)
  python-lxml (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  numpy (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  gtk2 and pygtk2 (on python2;  required to use GUI components)
  gtk3 and python bindings (on python3;  required to use GUI components)
  setuptools (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)


Recommended:
  python-pillow (required for Ricoh camera support and for representing parameters that are images)
  glade-3.6.7 (required for interative gtk2 widget layout; not needed for
               general use)
  datacollect2-qautils (not used directly, but documents checklist
                        format/structure and can render checklists as PDF)
  ipython (with PySide qt4 bindings) for interactive debugging of 
          processtrak scripts
  matplotlib (with qt4 support) for use with ipython for interactive
             debugging of processtrak scripts

Limatix is built with Python setuptools. 

To build from source package:
  python setup.py build

To install into Python site-packages 
  python setup.py install
  python setup.py install_data

Note that the install_data step also installs some useful files
into $(PREFIX)/share/limatix where $(PREFIX) is the Python
installation prefix. These include sample checklists, configuration
files, documentation, and processtrak steps.


Windows installation instructions
---------------------------------
1. Install Anaconda Python 2.7 version 32 BIT.
   http://www.continuum.io
2. Get latest pygtk all-in-one package from www.pygtk.org
3. Install PyGTK all-in-one selecting the 32-Bit Anaconda Python
4. Open an Anaconda command prompt, change to your Limatix
   source tree directory, then run:
     python setup.py install
5. From an Anaconda command prompt you should now be able to
   run 'datacollect2', 'processtrak', etc.
6. Also obtain a good XML editor that supports syntax
   highlighting to associate with the various Limatix XML
   file types.
