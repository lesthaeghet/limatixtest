Prerequisites:
  python (version 2.7 or 3.x... 3.x is a bit of a work in progress)
  python-lxml (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  numpy (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  gtk2 and pygtk2 (on python2;  required to use GUI components)
  gtk3 and python bindings (on python3;  required to use GUI components)
  setuptools (often distributed with operating system or Python distribution)
  dataguzzler-lib


Recommended:
  python-pillow (required for Ricoh camera support and for representing parameters that are images)
  glade-3.6.7 (required for interative gtk2 widget layout; not needed for
               general use)
  datacollect2-QAutils (not used directly, but documents checklist
                        format/structure and can render checklists as PDF)
  ipython (with PySide qt4 bindings) for interactive debugging of 
          dcprocess scripts
  matplotlib (with qt4 support) for use with ipython for interactive
             debugging of dcprocess scripts

Datacollect2 can be installed simply by unpacking the archive in a suitable
location once these prerequisites are installed. You may want to add the
'bin' directory to your system PATH and/or insert symbolic links to the
files in the 'bin' directory. You may also want to add the 'lib' directory
to your system PYTHONPATH. 

To install into /usr/local/datacollect2 on Linux or Unix/MacOS platforms:
  "make"
  "sudo make install"
