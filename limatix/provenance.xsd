  1. Provenance model -
    a. We define artifacts (data) and processes. Artifacts are regular tags
       in the XML that may have "lip:wasgeneratedby" attributes indicating 
       the UUIDs of the processes that generated them. Processes are defined 
       by separate <lip:process> tags (and descendents of such tags) that 
       define the processes and subprocesses that have been applied 
       to the data. The <lip:process> tags contain <lip:used> tags which
       specify other tags and files which were referenced by the process
       or subprocess. 
    
    b. The hierarchy of process domains, <lip:process> tags and subprocess
       domains, which are <lip:process> tags within <lip:process> tags. 
       These domains correspond to processing steps.
       Processes can have sub-processes - for example steps in a larger process
       or application of a filter to each element in a sequence. All 
       <lip:process> tags SHOULD be direct children  of the main tag 
       of an XML file, or be descendents of those <lip:process> direct children, 
       although if an XML file is constructed from multiple XML files, that 
       may lead to the <lip:process> elements being deeper. 


    c. Each <lip:process> can reference tags <lip:used> that were accessed
       during the process. Can also reference source code with <lip:used>.
       The <lip:used> tag should usually have a "usedwasgeneratedby" attribute
       with the contents of the "lip:wasgeneratedby" attribute of the target 
       (uuid reference) or the file mtime. This is necessary so that we can
       detect if the target gets overwritten by another process. Please note
       that <lip:used> references the target tag itself, but NOT its children
       (except for immediate text nodes as children)

    d. Data dependent on provenance domains that have been obsoleted (i.e. if 
       elements within that domain have been overwritten, should be 
       automatically marked as bad by viewer tools - and these bad data 
       should be highlighted  by the tools !!!

    e. The lip:wasgeneratedby attributes of a regular tag defines the process 
       domain(s) which generated that tag and its associated text, BUT MAKE 
       NO IMPLICATION ABOUT THE TAG'S CHILDREN. The lip:wasgeneratedby 
       attribute refers by UUID to one or more lip:process 
       elements of the referring tag or lip:process siblings of one of its 
       parents, or to a lip:process child of such a lip:process element. 
       The lip:wasgeneratedby attribute is semicolon-separated and 
       of the form "uuid=abcd12345;uuid=3591adb;"

    f. lip:process elements may be nested representing sub-processes within
       larger processes. This is an implicit WasControlledBy contest
       (In the future may be able to use lip:contains or explicit WasControlledBy
       similar as a more flexible way to define such containment). Note
       that since <lip:process> elements are distinguished by uuid and
       uuid is created by hashing a serialization, each <lip:process> element
       needs, prior to serialization, enough content so as to make 
       its serialization unique and prevent hash collisions. Adding in a 
       timestamp and hostname/process info generally helps with this. 

    g. Distinguish between the provenance of an artifact tag and the total provenance of the 
       tag and everything inside it. The lip:provenance attributes and lip:used tags
       refer to artifact xml tags at the most granular possible level, treating 
       contained tags as independent of their parents. You can separately think about
       "total provenance" of a tag with its descendents, which would be the union 
       of the provenance of tag and descendents. 

    h. lip:process elements contain lip:used[type=pymodule] tags listing
     the versions of all loaded modules.

    i. One of the big challenges is in referring to tags in a consistent way within an 
       XML file that is constantly changing. The canonicalize_path module provides a 
       mechanism based on determining the best characteristic(s) of a tag to be used
       to index it within its parent. Be sure to add expressions for maching particular 
       tags to canonicalize_path/tag_index_paths.conf or 
       /usr/local/etc/tag_index_paths_local.conf!


   * How to propagate provenance data up and down the tree structure
     * Define the "root" (filesystem or individual file) to be at 
       the "top"
     * Provenance of an element applies to that element and 
       its attributes, but NOT to elements contained within that
       element, i.e. it does NOT propagate down to leaf nodes
       UNLESS it is explicitly declared with the tree prefix 
       which would be equivalent to specifying the same provenance
       for every element underneath it. 
     * Distinction between "total provenance" of an element - 
       union of provenance of the element and those underneath it
       from "specific provenance" of the element and its immediate
       attributes. 
     * Define "Provenance Target" as something that an element was 
       derived from, used, etc. 
     * Provenance target refers to a specific element but that 
       does not imply derivation from child elements underneath
     * Provenance target can be explicitly specified to include
       all descendant elements ("//" suffix), which is would be 
       equivalent to declaring specific provenance to each descendent.
   * The above structure is used both to describe provenance of Artifacts
     (XML Tag data) and provenance of Processes
     * An artifact shouldn't have direct "WasDerivedFrom" elements
       because that is ambiguous about how it was derived.
     * Instead, an Artifact WasGeneratedBy a Process that Used other
       elements and WasDerivedFrom its source code. 

 Provenance locations
 - - - - - - - - - - -
 Denoting a location is troublesome because we want to be able to 
 make relative references (because collections of files are often 
 moved around together)
 
 Also sometimes it is convenient to look at things in terms of files
 and sometimes in terms of xpaths. 

 A provenance location can be referred to with (in order of decreasing
 preference) 
  1. a relative Path - relative to the parent of the highest <lip:process> 
     ancestor of the <lip:process>  we are processing
  2. an absolute Path -  relative to the filesystem root, and probably 
     canonicalized. 
  These Paths can be referred to either -  and equivalently - through
  (a) Simplified Clark-notation XPaths - with file/dir references through db:file 
      and db:dir elements, hereafter referred to as ETXPaths
  (b) File paths, - if relative, we must be processing a <lip:process>
      element that is within the root node of a file - plus an XPath 
      relative to the root of that file, unless we are referring to the
      entire file. 
 Internally we always work with canonicalized absolute XPaths and 
 convert to the others on-demand. This is supported by the 
 canonicalize_path package.
