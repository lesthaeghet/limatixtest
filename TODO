+ dc:process hostname bug
    "Fixed" on 1/6 TL - This wasn't a bug as much as a confusion.  The code that validates hostname
      only does so when <prx:hostname> is not None, but the output at the propmt says the value is
      None rather than "" because of the split command in the format string, leading to confusion.
      Clarified in the error message that the correct way to eliminate hostname requirement is to 
      completely remove or comment out the <prx:hostname> tag.
